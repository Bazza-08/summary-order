## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. HTML- Simple clear structure with good class names.
2. CSS - Flexbox & centering objects.
3. Process - Clearly understand and plan the development of the project before beginning.
4. Tackle - components/section one at a time, don't move on until found the solution.
5. Start Mobile first.

### Continued development

1. My CSS is not very DRY, lots of repetition. Need to further myself in SASS to help clear a lot of unnecessary code.

### Useful resources

- [W3SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com) - helped me understand setting out media queries, and other css components.
